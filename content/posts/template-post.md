Happiness is very ill-defined term. It's often supported with some outcomes of life that you achieve. We often pose happiness as a destination but we seldom think of it as a journey. We look to frame the situation as, "If I lose 10 kgs, I'll be happy" or "If I graduate from an Ivy League school, I'll be happy". What happens when you do reach your destination of happiness? Is the transient state of happiness fulfil your desire? Can happiness last forever? 

As I was walking down the perilous of finding answers to most of the questions above, I came across "**TaittirÄ«ya** **Upanishad**". It's a folklore from India's past and likely composed around **6th Century BC.** I feel that it has a very succinct description of eternal happiness.
